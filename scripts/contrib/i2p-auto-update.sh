# i2p auto-update — weekly freshness check for the i2p router (i2p_ynh).
#
# The router's own self-updater is disabled by design (it would overwrite
# dpkg-managed files). This script is the automated substitute: it checks the
# official I2P apt repo and, only when a newer release exists, performs a
# proper packaged upgrade via `yunohost app upgrade` so configs/permissions
# are re-rendered correctly.
#
# Opt-in install: copy this file to /usr/local/bin/ and install the cron.d
# entry shipped next to it (or per README). Log: /var/log/i2p-auto-update.log
